## 4. üí° Recommendations

- **Market expansion**
  + The company should continue to **expand operations** in **young and fast-growing markets** like **Germany (3169% yoy growth rate) , Australia (960%), United Kingdom (243%) and France (220%)**.
  + **Touring bikes** are the **key products** to **Germany**. The company should prepare the **manufacturing capacity** for touring bikes to meet huge demand in German market. 
  + **Tires and tubes** are **best-selling** products in **Australia** while both **United Kingdom and France** prefer **road bikes** most.
    
- **Product diversification**
  + **Clothing** subcategories like **socks, shorts and jerseys** had **low sales in 2012**; however, they experienced **surge in sales** in 2013, indicating clothings are the **new potential product lines** and will contribute to future growth in revenues. The company should **invest more on clothings** for sport activities.
    
- **Customer retention strategies**
  + Since **customer acquisition triples** in the  **second half** of 2013, the company can launch **seasonal marketing campaigns earlier** in the year (e.g. pre-summer promotions) to **spread out customer acquisition** across quarters.
  + **Last months** of the year acquires **high number of new customers** but **average spending** is relatively **low**, the company can improve spending by running **time-limited offers around holiday periods**.
  + It is found that **Jan-June** customers and **July-Dec** customers have **different repurchase pattern**. So the company should tailor follow-up communication by cohort:
    + For **Jan‚ÄìJune** customers, schedule **reminders or offers** around the **2-month** mark.
    + For **July‚ÄìDec** customers, consider **monthly loyalty perks** or **product recommendations** to **maintain their faster repurchase pace**.
  + **Customers** acquired in the **first six months** have **higher average spendings**. **Demographic analysis, products purchased and acquisition channels** for this group can be conducted to **identify patterns**. These information will be used to **target similar potential customers**.
