#### ‚öí Query 1: Which subcategories contribute most to the total revenue by year?
```sql
WITH sales AS  
  (SELECT 
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y', sales.ModifiedDate) AS year,
      subcat.Name AS subcategory,
      ROUND(SUM(LineTotal),2) AS total_sales,
      SUM(OrderQty) AS item_qty,
      COUNT(DISTINCT SalesOrderID) AS order_qty,
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS sales
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` AS product 
      ON sales.ProductID = product.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS subcat
      ON CAST(product.ProductSubcategoryID AS int) = subcat.ProductSubcategoryID
  WHERE CAST(FORMAT_DATE('%Y', sales.ModifiedDate) AS int) IN (2012, 2013)
  GROUP BY 1,2
)

SELECT * FROM 
  (SELECT *
        , DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS ranked
  FROM sales)

#### üîé Insights:
- **Bikes** and **bicycle frames** are two **important product categories**, contributing most to total revenue.
- **Road Bikes** rank **#1** in **2012 and 2013**. However, sales **drop** from **$17.1M** in 2012 to **$14.8M** in 2013.
- **Mountain Bikes** rank **#2** in both years and experience an **increase in sales** from **$11.7M to $13M**.
- No presence in 2012, but **Touring Bikes** emerge to the top list in 2013 with **$8.4M**. **Road Frames** is **out of top 3** in 2013, suggesting a **decline in demand** for only-frame products.

#### ‚öí Query 2: What subcategories have the highest or lowest YoY growth rates based on quantities sold?
```sql
WITH quantity AS

    WHERE CAST(FORMAT_DATE('%Y', sales.ModifiedDate) AS int) IN (2012, 2013)
    GROUP BY 1,2)

SELECT *,
        (item_qty - prev_item_qty)*100/prev_item_qty AS YoY_gr
